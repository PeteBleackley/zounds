    A rule consists of three components: the source (the part of a
    word to change), the context (the surrounding context of the
    source), and the result (what the source changes into). The source
    and result components may each be empty (but not both within the
    same rule). The context component must contain a source
    placeholder.

    A rule is associated with a language and a date, and has a place
    in the sequence of rules within the language/date combination.

    Each rule is unique, even if two rules have the same components
    and the same language and date.

    A rule has links to the next rules in sequence, going both forward
    and back in time. There may be multiple next rules due to language
    branching.
